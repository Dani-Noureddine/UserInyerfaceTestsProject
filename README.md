# UserInyerfaceTestsProject
User Inyerface is a website made with the intention of creating the worst user interface possible. In this project I wrote automated tests to test different features, navigating through that website. I used NUnit, Selenium, and Aquality Framework.
Page object model was followed, and 4 tests have been written testing filling in the page's cards, hiding the help form, accepting the cookies, as well as verifying that the timer in the website starts from 0.
